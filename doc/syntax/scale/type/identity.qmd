> Scales are declared with the [`SCALE` clause](../../clause/scale.qmd). Read the documentation for this clause for a thorough description of its syntax.

The identity scale is a special scale that allows the input to flow through unchanged. You can use this if your data already contains values in a format understood by the aesthetic, e.g. a column of color values mapped to fill. It doesn't take any additional settings.

Since the identity scale doesn't do any translation of data it doesn't create a legend.

### Examples

#### Use data values directly for size

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE bill_len AS x, bill_dep AS y, flipper_len AS size FROM ggsql:penguins
DRAW point
SCALE IDENTITY size
```
