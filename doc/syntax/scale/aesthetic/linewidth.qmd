title: Linewidth
---

The `linewidth` aesthetic sets the width of strokes and lines. It is measured in points (1pt = 1/72 inch). Linewidth can be used to represent continuous data. However, care should be taken because the eye is not good at differentiating the relative thinness of thin lines, and using thick lines will often result in severe overplotting.

## Literal values
Linewidth are given as bare numbers and measured in points. The following code sets the width of the lines to 3pt:

```ggsql
DRAW line
    SETTING linewidth => 3
```

## Palettes
Linewidth can only be used for sequential data and has no named palettes. The default for continuous, binned, and ordinal scales is to use the range from 1pt to 6 pt and interpolate between them. This can be overwritten by providing a manual output range specification

```ggsql
SCALE linewidth TO [3, 9]
```
