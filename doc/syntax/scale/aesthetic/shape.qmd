title: Shape

Shape palettes are used to map categorical values to different point shapes. They are specified in the `TO` clause of a `SCALE` statement when scaling shape:

```ggsql
SCALE shape TO shapes
```

ggsql includes 15 distinct point shapes organized into two categories:

1. **Closed shapes** - Shapes with enclosed areas that can be filled
2. **Open shapes** - Shapes made of strokes/lines without enclosed areas

## Closed Shapes

Closed shapes have an enclosed area and are rendered with a fill color. These are the most commonly used shapes for scatter plots and point markers. All closed shapes are area-equalized for consistent visual weight.

| Name | Shape | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `circle` | ![](examples/shape_circle.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Circular point (default) |
| `square` | ![](examples/shape_square.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Square point |
| `diamond` | ![](examples/shape_diamond.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Diamond/rhombus |
| `triangle-up` | ![](examples/shape_triangle_up.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Upward-pointing triangle |
| `triangle-down` | ![](examples/shape_triangle_down.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Downward-pointing triangle |
| `star` | ![](examples/shape_star.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | 5-pointed star |
| `square-cross` | ![](examples/shape_square_cross.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Square with X cutout |
| `circle-plus` | ![](examples/shape_circle_plus.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Circle with + cutout |
| `square-plus` | ![](examples/shape_square_plus.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Square with + cutout |

## Open Shapes

Open shapes are made of strokes without an enclosed fill area. These are useful when you need shapes that don't obscure underlying data.

| Name | Shape | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `cross` | ![](examples/shape_cross.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | X shape |
| `plus` | ![](examples/shape_plus.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | + shape |
| `stroke` | ![](examples/shape_stroke.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Horizontal line |
| `vline` | ![](examples/shape_vline.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Vertical line |
| `asterisk` | ![](examples/shape_asterisk.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | 6-pointed asterisk |
| `bowtie` | ![](examples/shape_bowtie.svg){height=20 .lightbox} | Bowtie/hourglass |

## Shape Palettes

ggsql provides three built-in shape palettes:

### Default Palette (`closed`)

The default palette contains the 9 closed shapes:

```ggsql
SCALE shape TO closed
```

This is the recommended palette for most use cases, as closed shapes are more visually prominent and easier to distinguish at small sizes.

### All Shapes Palette (`shapes`)

Contains all 15 shapes, ordered by visual distinguishability:

```ggsql
SCALE shape TO shapes
```

Shapes are ordered: closed shapes first (most distinguishable), then open shapes.

### Open Palette (`open`)

Contains only the 6 open shapes:

```ggsql
SCALE shape TO open
```

Use when you want transparent shapes that don't obscure data.

## Custom Shape Lists

You can specify a custom list of shapes:

```ggsql
SCALE shape TO ['circle', 'square', 'triangle-up']
```

## Choosing Shapes

### For general categorical data

Use **closed shapes** for most applications:

- More visually prominent
- Easier to distinguish at small sizes
- Work well with color encoding

### For overlapping data

Use **open shapes** when points overlap:

- Don't obscure underlying points
- Work well at higher densities
- Good for comparing distributions

### For combined encoding

Combine shape with color for redundant encoding:

```ggsql
DRAW point
    MAPPING x AS x, y AS y, category AS color, category AS shape
SCALE shape TO shapes
SCALE color TO tableau10
```

### Accessibility considerations

- Limit to 6-7 distinct shapes for readability
- Combine with color for redundant encoding
- Use larger point sizes when using complex shapes
- Closed shapes are more visible than open shapes
