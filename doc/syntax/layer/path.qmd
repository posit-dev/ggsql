title: "Path"
---

> Layers are declared with the [`DRAW` clause](../clause/draw.qmd). Read the documentation for this clause for a thorough description of how to use it.

The path layer is used to create lineplots, but contrary to the [line layer](line.qmd) the data will not be connected along the x-axis. Instead records are connected in the order they appear in the data. Lines are divided due to their grouping, which is the combination of the discrete mapped aesthetics and the columns specified in the layers [`PARTITION BY`](../clause/draw.qmd#partition-by).

## Aesthetics
The following aesthetics are recognised by the path layer.

### Required
* `x`: Position along the x-axis
* `y`: Position along the y-axis

### Optional
* `colour`/`stroke`: The colour of the path
* `opacity`: The opacity of the path
* `linewidth`: The width of the path
* `linetype`: The type of path, i.e. the dashing pattern

## Settings
The line layer has no additional settings

## Data transformation
The line layer does not transform its data but passes it through unchanged

## Examples

```{ggsql}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Create example data"
CREATE TABLE df AS
SELECT * FROM (VALUES
  (1.0, 1.0, 'A'),
  (2.0, 1.0, 'A'),
  (1.0, 3.0, 'A'),
  (3.0, 1.0, 'B'),
  (2.0, 3.0, 'B'),
  (3.0, 3.0, 'B'),
) AS t(x, y, id)
```

Simple example path.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE x, y FROM df
  DRAW path
```

Contrary to `line` drawings, `path` is not forced to follow the order along the axis.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE x, y FROM df
  DRAW path MAPPING 'Path' AS colour
  DRAW line MAPPING 'Line' AS colour
```

Groups of individual paths can be declared via `PARTITION BY`.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE x, y FROM df
  DRAW path PARTITION BY id
```

Invoking a group through discrete aesthetics works as well.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE x, y FROM df
  DRAW path MAPPING id AS colour
```

Compared to polygons, paths don't close their shapes and fill their interiors.

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE x, y FROM df
  DRAW polygon MAPPING 'Polygon' AS stroke
  DRAW path MAPPING 'Path' AS stroke
```
