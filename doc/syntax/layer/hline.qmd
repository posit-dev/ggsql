title: "H Line"
---

> Layers are declared with the [`DRAW` clause](../clause/draw.qmd). Read the documentation for this clause for a thorough description of how to use it.

The hline layer is used to draw horizontal reference lines at specified y-values. This is useful for adding thresholds, means, medians, or other horizontal guides to plots. The lines extend across the full extent of the x-axis, regardless of the data range.

## Aesthetics
The following aesthetics are recognised by the hline layer.

### Required
* `y`: The y-coordinate for the horizontal line

### Optional
* `colour`/`stroke`: The colour of the line
* `opacity`: The opacity of the line
* `linewidth`: The width of the line
* `linetype`: The type of the line, i.e. the dashing pattern

## Settings
The hline layer has no additional settings.

## Data transformation
The hline layer does not transform its data but passes it through unchanged.

## Examples

Add a horizontal threshold line to a time series plot:

```{ggsql}
SELECT Date AS date, temp AS temperature
FROM ggsql:airquality
WHERE Month = 5

VISUALISE date AS x, temperature AS y
  DRAW line
  DRAW hline MAPPING 70 AS y
```

Add multiple threshold lines with different colors:

```{ggsql}
WITH thresholds AS (
    SELECT * FROM (VALUES
        (70, 'Target'),
        (80, 'Warning'),
        (90, 'Critical')
    ) AS t(value, label)
)
SELECT Date AS date, temp AS temperature
FROM ggsql:airquality
WHERE Month = 5

VISUALISE date AS x, temperature AS y
  DRAW line
  DRAW hline MAPPING value AS y, label AS colour FROM thresholds
```
