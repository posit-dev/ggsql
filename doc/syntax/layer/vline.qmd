title: "V Line"
---

> Layers are declared with the [`DRAW` clause](../clause/draw.qmd). Read the documentation for this clause for a thorough description of how to use it.

The vline layer is used to draw vertical reference lines at specified x-values. This is useful for adding event markers, cutoff dates, or other vertical guides to plots. The lines extend across the full extent of the y-axis, regardless of the data range.

## Aesthetics
The following aesthetics are recognised by the vline layer.

### Required
* `x`: The x-coordinate for the vertical line

### Optional
* `colour`/`stroke`: The colour of the line
* `opacity`: The opacity of the line
* `linewidth`: The width of the line
* `linetype`: The type of the line, i.e. the dashing pattern

## Settings
The vline layer has no additional settings.

## Data transformation
The hline layer does not transform its data but passes it through unchanged.

## Examples

Add a vertical line to mark a specific value:

```{ggsql}
VISUALISE FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW point MAPPING bill_len AS x, bill_dep AS y
  DRAW vline MAPPING 45 AS x
```

Add multiple reference lines with different colors:

```{ggsql}
WITH markers AS (
    SELECT * FROM (VALUES
        (40, 'Threshold 1'),
        (45, 'Threshold 2'),
        (50, 'Threshold 3')
    ) AS t(position, label)
)
VISUALISE FROM ggsql:penguins
  DRAW point MAPPING bill_len AS x, bill_dep AS y
  DRAW vline MAPPING position AS x, label AS colour FROM markers
```
